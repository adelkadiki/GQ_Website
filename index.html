        <p>We understand that Architects and Designers are devoted to the planning, designing, and overseeing of projects.  GQ Flooring understands the importance of staying current and in-tune with the trends of today.  Since space and ambience need to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental, and aesthetic considerations; we strive to ensure that the flooring process is a seamless experience.  From selection to installation – our team of friendly professionals will ensure that you are happy with the results.

            Through our membership with the BCFCA, we have access to current up-to-date Architectural Specification Guides – these guides let the General Contractor and Architect know how to proceed with an installation.  It is strongly recommended that Consultants use these Specification Guides for their project flooring specification requirements.</p>
